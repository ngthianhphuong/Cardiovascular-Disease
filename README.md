# Cardiovascular Disease Data Analysis
This project gives an overview of the relationship between medical examination features such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, glucose level and cardiovascular disease risk.
Besides, based on given data, I answer some questions of interest that might be useful for people who are interested in medicine data analysis.
## Installation
This project requires Python and classical librairies used in data science such as pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
To easily check the code at the same time as the output, it is recommended to install Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook.
## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 70 000 records of patients, with 11 features and 1 target variable. The features are classified into 3 categories: 
- objective: such as patient's age, height and weight;
- examination: such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc;
- subjective: such as whether patient smokes or practices sport.
Target variable indicates whether that patient has cardiovascular disease.
## Project Motivation
We usually have assumptions that only elder people are concerned by cardiovascular disease. Work on this project helps me to answer my questions of interest, to better understand the mecanism of this popular disease and to verify the usual assumptions.
I will be answering the following questions:
1. How are examination features such as blood pressure, cholesterol level and glucose level related to cardiovascular disease?
2. Are normal blood pressure people safe from cardiovascular risk?
3. What is the right weight for height ratio that has the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease?
4. Does physical activity bring any help to overweighted people in preventing cardiovascular disease risk?
## File Description
Template code is provided in the ```cardio.ipynb``` notebook file. You will also be required to download the dataset ```cardio.csv``` to have the code run successfully.
## Result summary
A non-technical summary of this project's results can be found in this Medium post.
